# Project Goals

Our goal with Code Scape is to create a fun and engaging microgame FPS that utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create a modular and extensible codebase. We aim to create a variety of enemies with different behaviors and attack patterns, and design levels that provide a challenging and rewarding experience for players. We also want to implement a scoring system that encourages replayability and competition among players, and create an immersive atmosphere through sound and visual effects.

# Project Timeline

Our team plans to complete Code Scape in a total of eight weeks, with each week focused on a specific aspect of development. We will spend the first few weeks designing game mechanics and creating basic player movement and shooting functionality. From there, we'll create enemy and weapon classes, design level layouts, and implement a scoring system. We'll spend the final weeks polishing and fine-tuning gameplay mechanics, sound effects, and visual effects, testing the game to ensure it is stable and free of major issues, and finalizing the project for release.
Project Deliverables

Our team will deliver a playable game executable, source code repository, documentation on game mechanics and code structure, and art assets used in the game. We want to ensure that players have a smooth, seamless experience when playing Code Scape, and will work tirelessly to ensure that the game is stable and free of major issues.
